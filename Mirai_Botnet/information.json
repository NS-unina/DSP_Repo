As we can see some elements have been assigned a static IP address, this choice was made simply for practical purposes, and we will clarify why later. Using the docker-compose all the elements we see in the figure are instantiated. <br />C&amp;C: Through the command \"telnet 172.20.0.2\" it will be possible to connect to the C&amp;C and be able to know the number of bots present in the network, see what types of attacks can be used and finally be able to perform a real attack. To see what types of attacks are, just send the command \"?\" to the C&amp;C.</li>\n<li><strong>Bot_vittima</strong>: The victim_bot represents a vulnerable IoT device, in fact, as you can see from the Dockerfile of this element, username and password have been set as root: root. In addition, this element will expose port 23 to the outside with the telnet service associated with it. We decided to assign a static IP address to the bot_vittima so that we can immediately search for this address on wireshark and immediately see that the newly infected IoT device also participated in the attack.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Scanner and bot_n</strong> are based on the same docker image, this is because in this simulation it is possible to manually insert a bot into the network. The bot requires 4 input parameters when it is run: <code>&lt;cnc ip&gt; &lt;local p&gt; &lt;callback ip&gt; &lt;scanner 0/1&gt;</code>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li>By instantiating a bot with <code>scanner = 1</code>, we are adding a bot that will scan the network for vulnerable IoT devices (our victim_bot).</li>\n<li>By instantiating a bot with <code>scanner = 0</code>, we are adding a bot that will not scan the network, but will be passively active waiting for commands from the C&amp;C.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Loader:</strong> The loader is the component that will take care of infecting the new vulnerable devices discovered by the scanner. Its IP address is static, because this address must be entered as a callback address for the bot, and therefore must be known a priori.</li>\n<li><strong>Server_vittima</strong>: is obviously the target of our attack and can be contacted at 172.19.0.2. It is based on the httpd docker image and represents a simple webserver that can be contacted on port 1111.<br /><br /><br /></li>\n</ol>","solution":"<h3>How to reproduce the attack scenario</h3>\n<p><strong>Set-up phase for the attack</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Once the laboratory has been initialized, using the command shell of your host, you can contact the C&amp;C via <code>telnet 172.20.0.2</code></li>\n<li>Enter for both username and password: <code>root</code></li>\n<li>Once we enter the C&amp;C we wait for all the bots to be connected to it (by default the laboratory instantiates 30 bots).</li>\n<li>Via DSP connect to the scanner command shell</li>\n<li>From the command shell of the scanner, use the command <code>sh init.sh 1</code></li>\n<li>If all goes well, we will notice that the number of bots connected to our network will be 32, one will be the scanner and the other will be the victim_bot that we will have taken possession of. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Attack phase</strong> </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Using DPS, connect to the bot_n shell.</li>\n<li>From the bot_n command shell, ping the target address of the victim using \"<code>ping 172.19.0.2</code>\".</li>\n<li>Return to the C&amp;C command shell to launch the attack</li>\n<li>Do <code>udpplain 172.19.0.2 30</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>From the bot_n command shell we can see how the ping time increases, indicating that the victim server is being stressed by the attack in progress.

In this case, the server is busy handling a lot of TCP synchronization requests and takes longer to respond to simple echo_request icmp.</p>","readme":"","difficulty":"Medium","author":"NS"}
