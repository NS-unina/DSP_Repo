{"description":"","goal":"<p>The goal of this project is to exploit a Reflected XSS vulnerability (non-persistent).<br /><br />In particular, the scenario concerns the theft of a session cookie that will take place through the construction of a forged link with a malicious script, which will then be sent by email to the victim who will click on it and activate the script, starting the attack.</p>","solution":"<p>In general, the target of both persistent and non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting attacks is the end user of the Web Application.<br />Such attacks exploit the lack of control over the input data entered by the user, allowing malicious users to forge fake URLs<br />to implement the attack (stored-XSS, Reflected-XSS, DOM-Based XSS).<br /><br />To use the laboratory and test the proposed scenario, the following steps are required:<br /><br /><strong>Passo 1</strong>. After starting the lab, open the terminal of the attacking machine (Kali) and execute the following commands:<br /><br /><strong>python3 gmailsmpt.py</strong> -&gt; Execution of the python script that allows to send an email with the forged link<br /><br /><strong>nc -lvp 9999</strong> -&gt; using netcat to listen on port 9999 where the attacker will receive the stolen cookie</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Passo 2</strong>. Simulating the victim's behavior, open a browser (on the same host) and access the Gmail email with the following credentials:<br /><br />- Email address: NS.Striker21@gmail.com<br />- Password: esamediNS<br /><br />The email containing the forged link will arrive (disguised as a seemingly harmless link) which, as soon as the victim clicks on it, will start the malicious script and consequently the attack.</p>\n<p><br />NOTE: By simply replacing the victim's email address in the code, it is possible to simulate the attack with any email address<br /><br /><strong>Passo 3.</strong> Return to the Kali terminal where the HTTP request made by the victim will be shown and which will contain the session cookie, through which the attacker can take over the victim's session (in our case the account on the target site).</p>","readme":"","author":"AgrestiCasizzone"}
