{"description":"","goal":"","solution":"","readme":"# Pivoting, port forwarding and tunneling security laboratory.\nSecurity lab showing the use of a compromised host to pivot into internal networks. \n**The goal is to compromise a web application, and later, delve deeper into the network to access hosts that you cannot directly reach from your attack host using different approaches**.\n\nThe documentation can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/cxnturi0n/pivoting-tunneling-lab/blob/main/Documentation.pdf). It will demonstrate you, step by step, how to perform pivoting, port forwarding, and tunneling using different techniques and tools, while also explaining the theoretical basics behind them.\n\nTo access the lab network you will need to connect to the Kali Linux host, as explained in the *Lab Setup* section of the documentation.\n\n**Please give it some minutes to download all the images.**\n# Lab overview\n\n![lab_overview](https://github.com/cxnturi0n/pivoting-tunneling-lab/assets/75443422/fccc38ac-a715-475b-b9ee-7ab2aa7e7a04)","author":"FabioCinicolo"}
