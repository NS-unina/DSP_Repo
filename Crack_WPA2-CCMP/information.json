If you do not specify a folder this file will be saved in your home directory.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/hvcFm8D3/Screenshot-from-2020-10-08-12-16-31.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"691\" height=\"150\" /><br /><code></code></p>\n<p>Airodump-ng will show you real time informations about the visible Access point in the area and the stations connected to it. In this case we have one access point (the modem) and two stations that will connect to it.</p>\n<p>What we need to know about all these informations?</p>\n<p>BSSID : it's the mac address of all the visible routers in the area</p>\n<p>ESSID : the name of our target modem to hack</p>\n<p>ENC-CIPHER-AUTH : these three fields specify the type of encryption of the packets and the authentication protocol.</p>\n<p>Since in our case it is WPA2-CCMP-PSK we need to wait for an handshake to come. When a station, that it could be a mobile station or not, begins the authentication process with the AP it will begin the 4-way-hadshake that we need to capture in order to start an offline bruteforce attack.</p>\n<p>In this case we will perform a passive attack, waiting for the station to connect to the AP, that will happen at around 1 minute. In a real scenario if it takes too much time, you could send a deauthentication attack to a station that is connected to the target AP, forcing it to reconnect so you can capture the new handshake.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/XqVhqVLR/Screenshot-from-2020-10-08-12-16-49.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"655\" height=\"139\" /></p>\n<p>Once you see on the top right \"WPA Handshake : 6A:D5:26:64:88:DA\" it means that the station whose BSSID is 6A:D5:26:64:88:DA has attempted to connect to the AP. At this point you can stop collecting packets and stop airodump with CTRL-C.<code></code></p>\n<p>&nbsp;In this guide I will not go in the details on how aircrack-ng performes the attack. In a very simplified way, it tries to find the PSK key by a bruteforce attack, using a dictionary of passwords. However if the password is not contained in the dictionary it is nearly impossible to find it.</p>\n<p>Find your .cap file in your directory (in my case the file name is packets.cap-01.cap). Download the rockyou dictionary from internet and launch :</p>\n<p><em>aircrack-ng packets.cap-01.cap -w rockyou.txt</em></p>\n<p>The password should be found at around 5% of the dictionary and it is...</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/SR3W5dng/Screenshot-from-2020-10-08-14-00-48.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"652\" height=\"536\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;... jhonnybravo</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/43fhWq8J/Screenshot-from-2020-10-08-14-02-50.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","readme":"","difficulty":"Medium","author":"NS"}
