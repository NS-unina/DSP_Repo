Then start the server on the server container with \"python3 serverExt.py\". After that you can start the client on the client container with \"python3 clientExt.py\".</p>\n<p>Once started, the client will prompt for an IP, so let's use the IP of the server, which is 193.20.1.2.</p>\n<p>Now have fun chatting using this awful chat!</p>","readme":"","difficulty":"Beginner","author":"NS"}
