{"description":"SMURF DDoS Attack","goal":"<p>The main goal of this lab is to&nbsp;<em>tear&nbsp;down the Victim host, using ICMP Echo Ping Requests</em>. To acheve it, you can use the Attacker host.</p>\n<p>You can use the <strong>hping3 tool</strong>, to forge the packets.

The source IP odf this packets is set up to the spoofed Victim IP, using --spoof [IP] flag</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;you&nbsp;want to&nbsp;see the effects of the attack, you can use Wireshark to capture the packets&nbsp;or you can&nbsp;open&nbsp;the shell of one of the SMURF hosts and try to ping the Victim (ping 193.20.1.250)&nbsp;</p>","readme":"## SMURF Attack\n\nThe **Smurf attack** is a *Distributed Denial of Service* attack in which large numbers of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets (**Echo Ping Requests**), with the victim's spoofed IP as source IP, are broadcast to a computer network using an IP broadcast address. \n\nMost devices on a network will, by default, respond to this by sending a reply to the source IP address (**Echo Ping Replies**). If the number of machines on the network that receive and respond to these packets is very large, the victim's computer will be flooded with traffic. This can slow down the victim's computer to the point where it becomes impossible to work on.\n\nThis Lab is composed by 3 main actors:\n1.  **Attacker**: The host who starts the attack, using **hping3 tool**\n2.  **Victim**: The host who will be flooded by ICMP Echo Replies and will be tear down\n3.  **SMURFs**: Unintentional accomplices who will flood the victims with ICMP Echo Replies\n\nActually the labs is set up with 150 SMURFs.","author":"munnomario"}
