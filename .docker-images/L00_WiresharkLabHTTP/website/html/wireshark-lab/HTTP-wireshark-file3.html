  <em>12 things to know about relativity</em>
</center>

<p>Einstein's theories of relativity revolutionized how the world thinks
about space, time, mass, energy and gravity.
</p><p><a name="1"><strong><h3>Fact I</h3></strong></a>

<p></p><p>Prior to Einstein, Isaac Newton's laws were used to understand 
the physics of motion. In 1687, Newton wrote that gravity affects everything
in the universe. The same force of gravity that pulled an apple down from
a tree kept the Earth in motion around the sun. 
But Newton never puzzled out the source of gravity.

</p><p><a name="2"><strong><h3>Fact II</h3></strong></a>

<p></p><p>Philosopher David Hume's 1738 "A Treatise of Human Nature"
was a big influence on Einstein's thinking about space and time. Hume
was an empiricist and skeptic, believing that scientific concepts must 
be based on experience and evidence, not reason alone. He also held
that time did not exist separately from the movement of objects.
"It is very well possible that without these philosophical studies 
I would not have arrived at the solution", Einstein wrote.

</p><p><a name="3"><strong><h3>Fact III</h3></strong></a>

<p></p><p>In 1905, Albert Einstein based a new theory on two principles.
First, the laws of physics appear the same to all observers. Second,
he calculated the speed of light - 186,000 miles per second (299,338 kilometers
per second) - is unchanging. Prior to Einstein, scientists believed that space 
was filled with liminiferous aether that would cause the speed of light to change
depending on the relative motiono of the source and the observer.

</p><p><a name="4"><strong><h3>Fact IV</h3></strong></a>

<p></p><p>As a result of these principles, Einstein deduced that there is no 
fixed frame of reference in the universe. Everything is moving relative to 
everything else, hence Einstein's theory of relativity.
It is known as special relativity because it applies only to special cases: 
frames of reference in constant, unchanging motion. In 1915, Einstein published 
the general theory of relativity, which applies to frames that are accelerating
with regard to each other.

</p><p><a name="5"><strong><h3>Fact V</h3></strong></a>

<p></p><p>Time does not pass at the same rate for everyone. A fast-moving observer 
measures time passing more slowly than a (relatively) stationary observer would.
This phenomenon is called time dilation.

</p><p><a name="6"><strong><h3>Fact VI</h3></strong></a>

<p></p><p>A fast-moving object appears shorter along the direction of motion,
relative to a slow-moving one. This effect is very subtle until the object
travels close to the speed of light.

</p><p><a name="7"><strong><h3>Fact VII</h3></strong></a>

<p></p><p>Mass and energy are different manifestations of the same thing.
Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, means "a quantity of energy is equivalent 
to a quantity of mass times the speed of light squared". This is what
enables the release of a huge amount of energy from a nuclear explosion.

</p><p><a name="8"><strong><h3>Fact VIII</h3></strong></a>

<p></p><p>As a result of E=mc^2, a fast-moving object appears to have increased 
mass relative to a slow-moving one. This is due to the fact that increasing an object's 
velocity increases its kinetic energy and, therefore, its mass (since mass = energy).

</p><p><a name="9"><strong><h3>Fact IX</h3></strong></a>

<p></p><p>The increase in mass is the reason that Einstein says that matter cannot 
travel faster than light. The mass increases with velocity until the mass becomes 
infinite when it reaches light speed. An infinite mass would require infinite
energy to move, so this is impossible.

</p><p><a name="10"><strong><h3>Fact X</h3></strong></a>

<p></p>
<p>Space and time are part of one continuum, called space-time. In Einstein's
mathematics, space has three dimensions, and the fourth dimension is time. More
recent theories presume extra dimensions that we do not perceive.
Space-time can be thought of as a grid or fabric. The presence of mass distorts
space-timem so the rubber sheet model is a popular visualization</p>

</p><p><a name="11"><strong><h3>Fact XI</h3></strong></a>

<p></p>
<p>Relativity explains where gravity comes from. The rubber sheet model shows 
that gravity results from massive objects warping space-time. The warp is called
a gravity well. Orbiting objects follow the path that is shortest and requires the
least amount of energy. The planets move in ellipses, the most energy-efficient path
in the gravity well of the sun.
</p>

</p><p><a name="12"><strong><h3>Fact XII</h3></strong></a>

<p></p>
<p>Gravity bends light. This phenomenon is called gravitational lensing. When we 
observe a distant galaxy, the gravity of matter between Earth and the galaxy causes
light rays to be bent into different paths. When the light reaches the telescope, 
multiple images of the same galaxy appear.
